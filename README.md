# Bank_account_fraud_detection
This is the project I created for the business analysis course for the year 2023 in my computer science master degree track in artificial intelligence at the Università degli studi di Genova.

I used this dataset in the project: [Bank Account Fraud Dataset Suite (NeurIPS 2022)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022/data)
> Here you can find the processed dataset: [Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19yJMc_P9PpwfqLp4NiloRzB6UzCy-pDl?usp=sharing) (In the .ipynb file I used the dummies.csv file)
